## what is this repo

As the name suggests, this is my fork of the great [HyDE](https://github.com/HyDE-Project) Project dotfiles.

> [!CAUTION]
> These dotfiles are heavily personalized. Do **not** install them on your system unless you [know](hydotfiles.wiki/Guide.md) what you are doing.

## why is it public


> [!TIP]
> If you don't know what you're doing, the [wiki](https://github.com/schmynth/hydotfiles/wiki) of this repo might help. 
> It is a work in progress but does try to explain, how these and by extension the HyDE dotfiles work.
> Especially the [guide](https://github.com/schmynth/hydotfiles/wiki/Guide) goes into detail regarding the installed files, scripts and configuration.

Because I was fascinated by the Project HyDE dotfiles I decided to analyse their inner workings in order to:
- understand how they work
- understand how I can tweak them to make them my own
- check if they are safe to install and use
